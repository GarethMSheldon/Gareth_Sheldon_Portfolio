# Wazuh & Greenbone Vulnerability Management

**Project Duration**: December 2023  

## Overview

This project integrated **Greenbone Vulnerability Manager (GVM)** with **Wazuh** to enhance network security and streamline threat management processes. The integration leveraged GVM's active scanning capabilities alongside Wazuh's real-time monitoring to improve threat detection, automate remediation, and centralize monitoring efforts.

## Key Objectives

1. **Enhanced Threat Detection**:  
   - Combine GVM's active scanning with Wazuh's real-time monitoring to promptly identify vulnerabilities and potential threats.  

2. **Automated Remediation**:  
   - Utilize scripts and Wazuh capabilities to automate responses to vulnerabilities detected by GVM, such as blocking IPs or isolating compromised hosts.  

3. **Centralized Monitoring**:  
   - Establish a unified dashboard for monitoring vulnerabilities and security events across the network.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setting Up Greenbone**:  
   - Installed and configured **Greenbone Vulnerability Manager (GVM)** and the **Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA)**.  
   - Defined scanning targets and configured policies to identify vulnerabilities effectively.  

2. **Integrating with Wazuh**:  
   - Configured Wazuh to process Greenbone vulnerability scan reports.  
   - Utilized Wazuh rules and decoders to analyze incoming data for actionable insights.  

3. **Automated Response Actions**:  
   - Developed custom scripts to trigger automated responses based on scan results.  
   - Leveraged Wazuh's capabilities to block malicious IPs and isolate vulnerable hosts.  

4. **Monitoring and Alerting**:  
   - Created a centralized security dashboard using Wazuh for real-time threat monitoring.  
   - Configured alerts and notifications to highlight critical vulnerabilities and threats.
